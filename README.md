# rankorderdata

A program for analyzing rank order data (i.e. the results of a survey question like 'Please rank the following fruits from best to worst.') The end goal of this program is to synthesize data from multiple participants into a single score for each item. A higher score means that more people were giving the item top rankings while a lower score means they gave it lower rankings. Results are averaged to create more readable results.
